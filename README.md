# Smatrix - Your Productivity Simplified

Smatrix is a task management app designed around the Eisenhower Matrix, empowering users to make quick and effective decisions about their tasks. It helps you:

- Do: Focus on urgent and important tasks.
- Schedule: Plan important but non-urgent tasks for the future.
- Delegate: Assign urgent but less important tasks to others.
- Limit: Minimize unimportant and non-urgent tasks.
- Later: Temporarily park undecided tasks.

# Why Smatrix?

We all face growing to-do lists. Smatrix helps you focus on what matters, aligning your tasks with your goals and maximizing your productivity.

# How to Use Smatrix

1. Start your day by assessing your to-do list.
2. Enter tasks and assign them to appropriate quadrants using easy radio buttons.
3. Take control: do, schedule, delegate, or remove distractions.
