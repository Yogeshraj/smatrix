This app involves making a quick decision about what to act on now either by doing it yourself or delegating to someone else, what to act on in the future, or what to drop from your to-do list.

**How to Apply this Technique** <br />
We all have an ever-growing to-do list, and PMs are certainly no exception. Because our responsibilities and demands limit our time, we have to choose carefully how we spend this precious resource to make sure that we align our tasks with our larger goals.

To get started with this technique, look at your to-do list at the beginning of the workday and assess which tasks can be done quickly right now either by you or someone else on your team, which ones to drop altogether, and which essential tasks to defer for now.
